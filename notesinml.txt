#Error analysis
when we get perfect model, If we want to improve it , we need to analyze the type of erro is this making.

firsst we prediction function 
>ie crss_val_predict ()
then calll the  confusion matrix 
>ie confusion_matrix()
>>> y_train_pred = cross_val_predict(sgd_clf, X_train_scaled, y_train, cv=3)
>>> conf_mx = confusion_matrix(y_train, y_train_pred)
>>> conf_mx
] to see in image representation
plt.matshow(conf_mx, cmap=plt.cm.gray)
plt.show()

### matrix wiill be considered as good if most images on the main diagonal .ie classified correctl
if the some image so some dark this means that there are few image of this image 


#####
plots of Errors

#### multilabel classification
